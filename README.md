# Cloud Bugsolution Claim Demo

This is a **simulated phishing-style wallet claim site** built for educational and awareness purposes. It replicates the structure and interface of suspicious crypto giveaway websites, commonly used by malicious actors to trick users into connecting their wallets.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is part of a cybersecurity awareness film. It demonstrates how **fake airdrop claim pages** are visually crafted to deceive users into connecting their Web3 wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet).

> ⚠️ This is **not** a real drainer. No wallets are connected, and no transactions occur. It is purely a **mock interface**.

## 🧪 Features

- Fake wallet connect interface
- Simulated connection animation
- Clean UI inspired by known drainer clones
- Responsive and lightweight frontend
